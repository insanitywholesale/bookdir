# next steps
- rethink how author (and publisher) is handled (what is submitted with a book, ID generation in redis is non-existent at this point)
- implement server functions
- add openapi docs to an http endpoint
- use a list of authors instead of one author
- list of repos to add
    * mongodb
    * scylladb
    * cockroachdb
    * couchdb
    * rethinkdb
    * etcd
    * neo4j
    * more postgres
        + sqlc
        + pgx
